# OpenCore EFI Settings Repository
---
## Caution:
- This is **ONLY** verified in my own desktop and use for my setting. If you use it in your own desktop, not guarantee it also can work fine. Please aware and decide whether using this EFI.
- The Ethernet KEXT **isn't** included in this EFI since I use the WIFI instead of LAN. So if you need LAN support, please find the KEXT and add it to kext folder by your self.
- Sleep is valid but not recommend since it may cause the WIFI card down.(Personally not meeting, but it is listed in the KEXT Q&A)

## My Environment:
- CPU: Intel i5 9400F
- Motherboard: Gigabyte B360M Aorus pro
- GPU: Sapphire RX 560XT(Will be recognize as RX 470)
- WIFI: Intel AX200
- SSD: Micron M500 120G
- Memory: Apacer 8G 2666MHZ * 2
